Budget-Buddy

Budget-Buddy is a secure finance management platform I built during my second year of Software Development using Symfony and modern web technologies — a project I designed, developed, and delivered independently.

This robust system earned high praise for its security architecture, clean UI, and comprehensive feature set.

Interactive financial reporting with Chart.js visualizations
PDF export and data backup features
Role-based access control and audit logging
🔧 Tech Stack:
Backend: Symfony 6, PHP 8
Frontend: Twig, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
Data Visualization: Chart.js
Database: MySQL
Security: Symfony Security, CSRF protection, password hashing

💡 What I Learned:

Building secure authentication and authorization systems
Developing complex data relationships with Doctrine ORM
Implementing professional-grade reporting and visualization
Writing maintainable, scalable PHP code in Symfony
Creating intuitive admin interfaces and user workflows
🏆 Reflection:

Budget-Buddy was where backend logic met frontend polish. It reinforced the importance of security in financial applications and showed me how clean architecture enables both functionality and trust. From transaction entries to interactive annual reports — every feature was built with intention.
