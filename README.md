💰 Budget Buddy: Sleek Finance Manager
Budget Buddy is a full-stack web application we created as a team assignment during the second year of my Software Development studies. The challenge was to build an advanced, secure, and data-driven financial management platform using modern tools like Symfony and Chart.js.

I am incredibly proud of the clean design and robust functionality we delivered. The project successfully showcases collaborative development and advanced framework utilization.

🔎 Project Overview & My Role

Budget Buddy is designed for efficient transaction management and data visualization. I was primarily responsible for the user interface/experience (UI/UX) and critical backend logic integration.

My key contributions included:

Design & Layout: Creating the "premium dashboard" look, defining the overall sleek styling, and ensuring a fully responsive layout for the entire website.

Admin Functionality: Developing and implementing the robust administrator system for managing users and system configurations.

Data Visualization: Integrating Chart.js to generate dynamic, clear reports and visualizations from financial data.

💼 Features

The platform provides users with powerful tools for financial insight:

Advanced Dashboard: A clean, intuitive interface providing instant financial status overviews.

Transaction Management: Secure handling and storage of all transaction data.

Dynamic Reporting: Detailed reports and interactive charts (Chart.js) for in-depth analysis.

User System: A secure user/admin system ensuring personalized and controlled access.
